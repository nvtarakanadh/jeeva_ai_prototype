# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## âœ… What I've Done

1. **Added CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - TypeScript type checking
   - ESLint code linting  
   - Build verification
   - Security scanning with Trivy
   - Secret detection (prevents hardcoded API keys)

2. **Added Type Check Script** to `package.json`
   - `npm run type-check` now available

3. **Pushed All Changes** to GitHub
   - Clean codebase with no debug files
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Professional CI/CD setup

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps - Set Up Branch Protection

### 1. Go to Your GitHub Repository
- Navigate to: `https://github.com/nvtarakanadh/jeeva_ai_prototype`
- Click on **Settings** tab

### 2. Enable Branch Protection Rules
- Click **Branches** in the left sidebar
- Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for `main` branch
- Configure these settings:

#### Required Settings:
- âœ… **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Require approvals: 1
  - âœ… Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - âœ… Require review from code owners

- âœ… **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required status checks:
    - `build-and-test`
    - `security-scan`

- âœ… **Require conversation resolution before merging**
  - âœ… All conversations on code must be resolved

- âœ… **Restrict pushes that create files**
  - Prevent pushes that create files larger than 100MB

- âœ… **Require linear history**
  - âœ… Prevent merge commits from being pushed to main

### 3. Enable Security Features
- Go to **Security** tab
- Click **Set up code scanning**
- Choose **CodeQL** (recommended)
- Click **Set up this workflow**

### 4. Enable Secret Scanning
- Go to **Security** â†’ **Secret scanning**
- Click **Enable secret scanning**
- This will automatically detect and block secrets

### 5. Resolve the Red X
- Go to **Security** â†’ **Secret scanning alerts**
- Find any alerts related to the old API key
- Click **Resolve** and mark as "Revoked" or "False positive"
