# Notification Navigation Test Guide

## Issue Fixed: Notification Click Navigation

### Problem
When clicking on notifications (especially consultation booking notifications), users were not being taken to the correct page.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Incorrect Action URLs**: Doctor notifications were using patient URLs
2. **Missing Role Detection**: Navigation wasn't role-aware
3. **Hardcoded Paths**: Notifications had hardcoded paths instead of role-based paths

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Role-Aware Navigation
- Added user role detection in `NotificationDropdown.tsx`
- Updated navigation logic to use different paths for doctors vs patients
- Added console logging for debugging

#### 2. Fixed Action URLs in Notification Service
- `createConsultationBookedNotification`: Changed from `/consultations` to `/doctor/consultations`
- `createConsentApprovedNotification`: Changed from `/consents` to `/doctor/consents`
- `createConsentDeniedNotification`: Changed from `/consents` to `/doctor/consents`

#### 3. Enhanced Debug Tools
- Updated debug component to show action URLs
- Added role-based test notification creation
- Added click handlers for testing

### Navigation Mapping

#### For Doctors:
- `consent_request/approved/denied` → `/doctor/consents`
- `prescription_created/updated` → `/doctor/prescriptions`
- `consultation_note_created/updated` → `/doctor/consultation-notes`
- `record_access_granted/denied` → `/doctor/patient-records`
- `consultation_booked/updated` → `/doctor/consultations`
- `ai_analysis_complete` → `/ai-insights`
- `health_alert/system` → `/doctor/dashboard`

#### For Patients:
- `consent_request/approved/denied` → `/consent-management`
- `prescription_created/updated` → `/prescriptions`
- `consultation_note_created/updated` → `/consultation-notes`
- `record_access_granted/denied` → `/patient-records`
- `consultation_booked/updated` → `/consultations`
- `ai_analysis_complete` → `/ai-insights`
- `health_alert/system` → `/dashboard`

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Test Role Detection
1. Go to `/notification-test`
2. Check if user role is detected correctly
3. Create a test notification
4. Verify the action URL is correct for the user's role

#### 2. Test Navigation
1. Click on a notification in the dropdown
2. Check browser console for navigation logs
3. Verify you're taken to the correct page
4. Test both doctor and patient roles

#### 3. Test Consultation Booking
1. As a patient, book a consultation
2. As a doctor, check notifications
3. Click on the consultation booking notification
4. Verify you're taken to `/doctor/consultations`

### Debug Information

The debug component now shows:
- User role
- Notification action URL
- Click handlers with console logs
- Role-based test notification creation

### Console Logs Added

When clicking notifications, you'll see:
```
Notification clicked: {notification object}
User role: doctor/patient
Navigating to: /doctor/consultations
```

### Files Modified

1. `src/components/layout/NotificationDropdown.tsx`
   - Added role detection
   - Updated navigation logic
   - Added console logging

2. `src/services/notificationService.ts`
   - Fixed action URLs for doctor notifications
   - Updated consultation booking notification

3. `src/components/debug/NotificationDebug.tsx`
   - Enhanced debug information
   - Added role-based testing
   - Added click handlers

### Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **Create a consultation booking notification**
2. **Click on it as a doctor**
3. **Verify you're taken to `/doctor/consultations`**
4. **Check console logs for navigation details**

The navigation should now work correctly for all notification types and user roles!
